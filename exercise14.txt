In 1926, Anna Pavlova (a famous Russian ballerina) visited Australia. To commemorate, a very large meringue was created and named in her honour. It is an Australian icon
and a favourite dessert among many. The problem is, it isn't actually an Australian invention.

In 1926, the same year as Ms. Pavlova's visit, two recipes of note were printed:
The first is for a "Meringue with Fruit Filling", printed in the cookbook Home Cooking for New Zealand. Ignore the name, it was written by an Australian.
The other recipe is for a dessert called a "Pavlova" in the cookbook Davis Dainty Dishes, written by a New Zealander. This was a jelly based recipe, however, not a meringue.

So then, conventional wisdom has been that Australia invented this large meringue and that New Zealand was the first to name a dessert after Ms Pavlova. Except, neither of those things is 
true. New Zealander Dr. Andrew Paul Wood and Australian Annabelle Utrecht recently published their findings after spending 2 years researching the origins of the pavlova. What they 
discovered is this: Firstly, the first dessert to be named Pavlova was actually the 'strawberries pavlova', also in a New Zealand cookbook. Secondly, this very large meringue is likely an 
18th century Austrian recipe that at some point made its way to America, where it was printed on boxes of corn starch that were exported to Australia and New Zealand.  

So who was the first to print a recipe for this very large meringue AND call it a pavlova? We can't know for sure, because as we know now, these meringues were everywhere in both countries
already, as was a propensity to name food after a famous Russian ballerina. However, there is a 1929 recipe for a "pavlova cake" from a cookbook in New Zealand. And we know that in 1935
an Australian hotel chef made this very large meringue and called it a pavlova.
